# Computer Vision Projects - Classical and Modern Approaches
Contains Computer Vision projects implemented with OpenCV and Python.

Projects aimed at:
1. Classical Computer Vision Techniques
2. Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning
3. Object Tracking and Localization

## Project One: Facial Keypoints Recognition

In this project, I combined my knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face! Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications.

The project is broken down into four main parts:

[Notebook 1](Module1_IntroductionToComputerVision/ProjectOne/1_LoadAndVisualizeData.ipynb): Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

[Notebook 2](Module1_IntroductionToComputerVision/ProjectOne/2_Define_TheNetworkArchitecture.ipynb): Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict Facial Keypoints

[Notebook 3](Module1_IntroductionToComputerVision/ProjectOne/3_FacialKeypointDetectionCompletePipeline.ipynb): Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and our trained CNN.

[Notebook 4](Module1_IntroductionToComputerVision/ProjectOne/4_ApplicationsKeypoints.ipynb): Applications using Facial Keypoints

## Project Two: Virtual Pen and Eraser
